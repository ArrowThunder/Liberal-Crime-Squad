stealth.cpp
2)
added a suspicion check for weapons that have been "holstered", meaning weapons carried in the squad inventory, but not equipped
Since weapons (including ammunition) cannot be taken to a site without being equipped to a squad member, this was an exploit (Unimplemented)
TODO Weapon concealment overhaul
currently basically all handguns are size 5, rifles size 15, and shotguns/smgs size 10.  Default value is 15.
All armors have a concealment rating of 5 except naked (0) and trenchcoat(10)
Dufflebag of guns seems worth considering.

3)
Car chase unit quantity is now based on logarithmic progression instead of linear.  Tweaking is likely necessary, but still.

6)
Mistakenly attacking innocents: if skill is 8 or higher, there is no chance of mistakenly hitting innocents (except when used as a human shield).
If skill is 7 or lower, the odds are based on skill, with a maximum of 10% chance at skill = 0;
Melee weapons only require a skill of 4.
If skill is 3 or lower, the odds are based on skill, with a maximum of 5% chance at skill = 0;

HUGE Bugfix:
The states were listed in the wrong order.
Correction:
"
Arizona
Arkansas
"
not
"
Arkansas
Arizona
"
Unfortunately, the state_bias of -2 for Arizona and -1 for Arkansas will only be corrected in new save files.  Old save files will continue to have them flipped around.


Another 78 external txt files
As a placeholder the new folder mostlyendings contains almost all of them.

Added external txt file "allText.txt"
It contains 476 lines from throughout LCS, meant to help facilitate translation without recompiling.

Transferred string data from help.cpp to externallyStoredData

transferred all ingame help information to helpTopics.txt

The remaining new files make up the bulk of the issue-based text now within art/talk/

This brings total external txt files to 285.

Substantial internal restructuring of includes.h
based on the work by Schmel924

Minor bugfixes:
newgames did not give the player a last name, along with certain newsstories
BUG CAUSED BY THE ABSENSE OF TYPE-SAFETY IN C++
Just when I was starting to like C++ it does this.

4.12.08 
Fixed usage of certain characters for names.
These six characters.
áéöúóí

TODO: random crashing when recruiting?  I have been unable to replicate the bug, it may be limited to Windows 10 or other unknowns.

4.12.09
üëòâô
Five more characters added to usable characters for names.
'¢' (which only appears in the name of a Puerto Rican city) is buggy in a way that requires an entirely separate fix from the other 11 characters
Otherwise, this amounts to all special characters currently present in LCS names.

Rolled back some changes in sneak attacks.

Note to self: If a character is given a name that starts with '#' and verbose save files are turned on, LCS will crash when the verbose save file is loaded.
This is because '#' is used at the beginning of a line to indicate a comment in human readable files.

HUGE Bugfix (no joke)
It seems that, upon game over, all save files are deleted (not just the current one).  This has been in place since before I got involved.
Still, fixed.

Fixed autosave problem.  Autosave was hard-coded to remain off, now it depends on init.txt

new class
title_screen
Handles most characteristics of new games, controls automatic savefile deletion and autosaving
This is part of an intitiative to eliminate most usages of the extern keyword

General housecleaning, reducing the number of times "creature.h" appears, as it is currently a massive cluster of interrelated header files.

Partial implementation of class CreaturePool, meant to replace all references to vector<Creature *> pool
For many files, vector<Creature *> pool is the only location where "creature.h" is required, and can therefore be removed once CreaturePool is implemented.
Partial implementation of class LocationsPool, meant to replace all references to vector<Location *> location
For many files, vector<Location *> location is the only location where "location.h" is required, and can therefore be removed once LocationsPool is implemented.

Got rid of 14 largely unnecessary files, mostly header files.  Consolidated the entire news folder into news.cpp
Since nearly all those functions were used exclusively within news.cpp, splitting them into separate files, separate headers, did nothing to reduce complexity, but bogged down compile time.  (clean build hovers at 2m 10s, down from 2m 15s, small enough that it could be a measurement error, but coupled with a reduced filesize of almost the exact same proportion.  Most likely coincidental, but academically interesting.)


4.12.10
Fixed cause of frequent crashes.  Blank multiline text was treated as single line text.

4.12.11
Fixed bug where files would not be deleted upon defeat.  (This bug was introduced when the "defeat deletes all savefiles" bug was fixed)
Fixed typo where "# - Check status of liberal" contained unusual characters.  It seems the txt file had some sort of metadata.  I do not know how to detect if this problem exists elsewhere.
Fixed bug where "V - Evade" appeared on the wrong line.

4.12.12
Rush job, reverted code to earlier version to finally fix the recruitment bug.

4.12.13
Fixed the missing personal ads.  Appears to have been an old bug.
Completed restructuring that was started in 4.12.09
(primarily the removal of unused header files and include statements)
Curiously, this has resulted in a substantial reduction in filesize.
'Upgraded' to VS 2017
New compile time 2m 40s, up from 2m 15s
New filesize 1515 KB, down from 1926 KB
Notably Visual Studio 2017 keeps a hidden folder .vs with a filesize of just under 2 GB.  It seems to accumulate size over time, as 4.12.12 has the same folder at 600 MB.  The fact it keeps crashing my PC makes more sense, as the SSD I keep Visual Studio on is... unreliable.
Minimum size for the folder appears to be 40 MB.
Microsoft is making it very hard not to hate them.

4.12.14
Fixed the university bug, where the new studies weren't fully implemented.
namely ACTIVITY_STUDY_CLUB, ACTIVITY_STUDY_STREETSENSE, ACTIVITY_STUDY_THROWING, ACTIVITY_STUDY_STEALTH, ACTIVITY_STUDY_SEDUCTION,
LCS is now considered Stable.

4.12.15
Fixed the ever evasive "stats changing during interrogation" bug.
Turns out it had nothing to do with interrogation.
Creature::get_attribute() modifies the attribute based on Juice and Age.  Not knowing about the Age part of the equation, age modifiers were being reapplied to creatures every time the game was saved.  (Ironically not including "Health", because Age modifiers for Health are aplied elsewhere in the code).

Also, shifted around some of the internal code.  Removing more usage of the keyword "extern", and all non-standard header files are now #included using relative paths instead of absolute paths.  (i.e. replacing #include <header.h> with #include "header.h" or #include "../header.h" etc.)  I'm excited about this change because it makes LCS easier to compile using g++, and once I can get LCS to compile with g++ I won't need to use Visual Studio anymore and I will finally be able to actually help other people compile the damn thing.

4.12.16
Used the software "CppDepend" for the first time.  Great stuff, detects all sorts of code smells, all sorts of everything.
Helped me fix bugs that hadn't even been reported, since, for example, it detects if statements that are always true.  This meant that a prison break would not report if more than one LCS member escaped in the process.  Pretty darn arcane, can't imagine a situation where that was ever going to be found.

The various key pressing in mode_site() have been relegated to individual methods.  If the player presses a movement or wait key, the method moveOrWaitThenCheckForExit() is called.  This method is far from optimal, as it currently requires ten parameters, three of which are passed by reference and potentially modified.

All instances of getkeyAlt() where the value is not stored or used have been replaced with a new method void pressAnyKey().  This amounted to 574 replacements, leaving only 123 times getkeyAlt() is actually needed.

Returned to using Visual Studio 2015.  Unable to get g++ to compile, but got closer than last time.

Removed most usage of keyword typedef.  Since they were just renamed map< , > the usage of "typedef" did not make the code clearer, I originally added those instances of keyword typdef because I didn't know how to use maps directly.

Removed tags from "allText.txt", as these are better off as constant strings.
Replaced a very large number of string literals with const strings.  This has resulted in most files #include "constant_strings.h"
Usage of blankString = "" is perhaps going overboard, and constitutes many of the instances.  Many header files now require constant_strings.h, especially because of blankString = "".
The file crimesquad.exe has significantly increased in size, from 1512 kB to 3148 kB.  It is assumed to also run slower, at least on startup, but this remains outside the perceptive abilities of the naked eye.
Pretty much for the hell of it, removed the file constant_strings.h and all references to it.  Resulted in new filesize of 1440 kB.  There is now some redundancy with "const string tag_... = ...;"  Many should probably be moved to header files.
All known instances of comparisons against string literals have been replaced with constants.  This is some 950+ const declarations, all with at least one replacement.
1211 lines with const string ... "
929 lines with #include "
190 lines with const char
8147 lines with "
Thus approximately 6000 string literals remain.
Terra Vitae 1.32 has 14000 lines with "
Measured TV because I don't have a copy of 4.10 on hand.
I have thereby removed an estimated 6000 ~ 8000 string literals from LCS during my tenure.  At this time I plan to automate the removal of the remaining string literals in one single endeavor.  The hardest part will be inspecting the files to ensure no side effects.

Fixed the "crash on recruit" bug.

4.12.17

5999 lines with const string ... "
931 lines with #include "
191 lines with const char
7704 lines with "
Extracted another 4788 string literals into constants.  Filesize increased to 1681 kB.
Changes in numbers of "const char" and "#include" are side-effect free mistakes on my part.
Decrease in "lines with \"" is due to removal of redundant strings, and some instances of multiple strings in a line becoming multiple constants.
Small number of string literals remain due to error in algorithm meant to remove them (mostly either multiple string literals on a single line or string literals that included multiple '"' characters).  Will likely remove manually.
Tweaked and ran the algorithm a few more times,

About twenty strings had to be removed manually.
in sitemode folder
grafitti = {"    ", "    ", "    ", "    "}
Can't immediately replace with const strings, something about initializing a char* with const char*
Considered inconsequential.

Thus, nearly all string literals have been extracted.  Near enough that I will continue to the next stage.

Fixed the "unable to obtain loot" bug.

4.12.18

Reduced complexity of prepareencounter() method.  Moved most of its data to a map<int, vector<int> >, eliminating roughly 600 lines of code.
Split up some of news.cpp
char story[5000] is now declared only on the scope it is needed, resulting in a few methods returning a string instead of modifying one by reference.
Altered damagemod() in fight.cpp
Split apart attack() - Needs more work, subroutine has 8 parameters
Split apart initsite()

Split apart advanceday()
Changed several function signatures to no longer require char &clearformess (whatever in the hell it even is.  these functions immediately changed its value without using it, now the value is changed before calling the function.  Thus &clearformess does not need to be passed at all, let alone by reference)
deleted daily/date.h
deleted daily/recruit.h
new function pressSpecificKey(...)
repeatedly calls getKey() until the specified key is pressed, for times when pressAnyKey() is not quite usable.

Bugfix:
Squads visiting apartments (that have been rented) are correctly prompted "Why is the squad here?   (S)afe House, to cause (T)rouble, or (B)oth?"  So, no more disbanding the squad in order to reassign their safehouse.
Weird friggin bug.

4.12.19

No changes in code, reinstalled operating system and then recompiled due to suspicion of virus on my computer.

4.12.20

Restructured much of the trial() method, extracted submethods pleadGuilty() and pleadInnocent()
Restructured the tend_hostage() method.  Mostly reduced scope of local variables y and p.
Minor changes to siege.cpp
Identified 155 instances of for loops using iterators declared outside the loop.
Found and removed the usage of displayads(... int &it2)
it2 is used in displayads() to pass to displaysinglead(), which uses it as an iterator, whose value is immediately reassigned to 0.
In other words, int &it2 isn't used for any reason.
Fixing fragile code is its own reward.
19 for loops with iterators declared outside remaining.  These ones, at least, have a reason to declare the iterator outside the loop.
regular expression used:
for\s*\(\w*\s*\=
Found a for loop within talkInCombat() that has an iterator declared outside the loop, but is not found by the regular expression.
			int e = 0;
			for (; e < ENCMAX; e++)
In this instance, this programming practice may be justified.

Removed an unused variable "nullify" from creaturePool.cpp monthlyRunTheSystem()

Removed extern vector<Locations*> from fight.cpp
Removed extern vector<Locations*> from reviewmode.cpp
Removed extern vector<Locations*> from sitemode.cpp
REMOVED  \src\daily\activities.cpp(285):extern vector<Location *> location; (double check when players bury bodies)
REMOVED  \src\basemode\basemode.cpp(158):extern vector<Location *> location;
  \src\title\saveload.cpp(132):extern vector<Location *> location;
  \src\sitemode\shop.cpp(113):extern vector<Location *> location; (Just about empty, last few instances are complicated)
REMOVED  \src\daily\siege.cpp(345):extern vector<Location *> location; (TODO Tons of cleanup, especially duplicate code, but that's the case everywhere)
REMOVED  \src\sitemode\talk.cpp(88):extern vector<Location *> location;
The remaining files using extern vector<Location *> location;

Discovered bug: Clothing suspicion level remains based on last location, making it red or whatever even after returning to base.
No change for ingame behavior, mostly only shows up if player visits location that even outside one is considered suspicious.
Low priority.

Added a function from loot.h to item.h, had previously been a new method for Loot class.

Deleted a few pointless header files.

LocationsPool.cpp is now about 3_000 lines, and the LocationsPool class possesses over 60 methods.  They have gone from part of the solution to being part of the problem.
This is especially the case with regards to siege.cpp, as my coding became increasingly redundant as fatigue wore on.

Added new key 'J' to reload weapons, but only weapons that are empty.
Not the best, but it does the job.

4.12.21

Deleted translateid.cpp, moved most of its guts over to globals.cpp, except the part that accessed vector<Creature *> pool, which was moved to creaturePool.cpp, and the part accessing vehicletypes, which was moved to vehicle.cpp
That said, translateid.cpp might work well as a class API.

globals.cpp is where most of the vector<...> are declared, and saveload.cpp has to access most everything, so if those are the only two references to a previously global vector, the work is basically done.

Removed instances of extern vector<vehicletype *> vehicletype, all except in vehicle.cpp and globals.cpp
Removed instances of extern vector<vehicle *> vehicle,  all except shopnstuff.cpp, saveload.cpp, and globals.cpp
Removed vector<datest *> date from everywhere except saveload.cpp.  Moved most of the uses to date.cpp

creaturetypes.cpp has a large switch statement of all creatures and their accepted work locations.
// TODO this can be extracted to a table

Moved the remains of creaturetypes.cpp to creaturetype.cpp
If only to end the confusion of the two files.

The #define AGE_SENIOR macros have been commented out, except for AGE_TEENAGER and AGE_YOUNGADULT, which are the only ones used.
verifyworklocation(Creature &cr, char test_type); contains a large switch statement of all creatures and their appropriate work environments.   This can be converted to a table at a later date.

removed vector<recruitst *> recruit from all except daily.cpp, globals.cpp and saveload.cpp

Deleted shopnstuff.cpp - Absorbed into daily.cpp

Replaced the Armor constructor Armor(&ArmorType ...) with Armor(int ...), as well as the related Creature method give_armor(&ArmorType ...) with give_armor(int ...)
This allows removal of nearly all instances of extern vector<ArmorType> armortype, except armor.cpp, activate.cpp,  activities.cpp, locationsPol.cpp, and shop.cpp
All except armor.cpp and shop.cpp have had the extern scope reduced to the method(s) calling it.

This allowed creature.h to stop calling armortype.h
7 files #include armortype.h, rather than the 42 that #include creature.h

#include locations.h removed from creatures.h
#include locations.h is now in 29 files, rather than 42.  Not much of an improvement.
#include locationsEnums.h is located in 8 files, in addition to those with #include locations.h

I intend to reduce the scope from the file level to the function level on any of these that haven't already.  The various extern strings will likely have to be dealt with differently, though they only number 384 at this time.

Matching lines: 4496    Matching files: 68    Total files searched: 158
Increase of about 800.  Found and removed a number of unused externs, most notably unused extern MusicClass music, which allowed the #include musicClass.h to be removed.
Apart from extern strings, about no extern usage on the global or file scope, save the aformentioned namespace conflict.

Shifted a few const strings to be within the functions calling them.  Decided the usefulness of such actions are dubious, started extracting parts of the interrogation function.

Some refactoring of creaturetype.cpp armCreature(Creature &cr, short type);
Used tuples in refactoring of creaturetypes.cpp.  tuples should replace many of the fixed length vectors I have used in the past.  Passed an array by reference.  May be worth passing other arrays by reference.
Replaced tuples with a struct.  Microsoft Visual Studio does not support tuples.  Not without going through a whole lot of extra trouble that isn't going to happen.

Added new automated tests that create all existing creatures, and arm them based on every possible gun control law.
As a side effect it creates all default locations, due to some overlap between the creature.cpp and locations.cpp code.

If someone runs the automated tests, it is recommended to restart the program before starting a new game.

Fixed a bug where Gentleman's Clubs were nameless.

4.12.22

Refactored news.cpp to remove most usage of char*
Regular expression to find char* and char arrays (including some that are not used as string substitutes)

Cleaned up formatting.
Slogans no longer have a 1/20 chance of using default_slogans.txt

Initiating process for single cpp file.
Moved nearly all source code to activate.cpp

All usage of keyword extern limited to the function scope, except for instances past line 52_384 (of 53_200 lines)
and extern string closeParenthesis;
Located in locationsPool.cpp

5_260 instances of "//"  Includes commented code that mostly can be removed.
New file simpleFunctions.cpp
Transfered a few functions out of activate.cpp that do not require anything other than constants and enumerators.
Note that it currently has #include "includes.h"
This will eventually be replaced.

Created new struct and function 
struct fullName {
	string first;
	string middle;
	string last;

};
fullName generate_long_name(char gender);
Probably not going to fully implement it.
moved constructPositiveEventStory(view); and constructNegativeEventStory(view); to simpleFunctions.cpp
Nearly at the point where this part of news stories can be stored externally.

Deleted bulk of useless comments (the #include "" and such, redundant copyright information, artefacts from multiple file version)
It's astonishing how much faster 'single file version' compiles.  Working out the issues to make 'multiple file version' compile just as quickly is still a priority.
The .exe even has a smaller filesize.  1672 KB instead of 1739 KB, though this is considered only academically interesting.

Minor shuffling of string constant, namely collections made entirely of string constants have had the string constants defined within the collections, rather than externally.  Two strings capable of being used interchangably are best kept together.
Deleted commented code.
Removed preprocessor #define FORMAT_OUTPUT
char sbuf[81]; has had its scope reduced from static global to function.
Likely to rewrite functions addstr_f(), mvaddstr_f(), addstr_fl(), and mvaddstr_fl()
All four, combined, are used 19 times.  Some variation of these functions could replace a large proportion of the approx. 3700 uses of addstr/mvaddstr.
Curiously, the number (4048) of "const string" exceeds the number (3769) of "addstr".  Nearly all "const string" are used exactly once, (obviously excluding const xml tags).  Replacing the string literals with variable const strings has unveiled the underlying redundant nature of these thousands of lines of code.
Amusingly, "addstrAlt(saysComma, gamelog);" appears 16 times.  This single string is used verbatim almost as many times as formatted strings are passed to addstr_f and co.
Gathered all const string.  3265 total.  Approx. 700 begin with " " approx. 50 begin with ", " approx. 100 begin with "'s" approx 20 begin with "." "!" or "?"

Replaced many of the "(story += x); (story += y)" with "story += x\ + y"
It was a relic from when these lines were strcat(..., ...);
Removing the parentheses helped clear up when numbers are added to the string, making sure tostring(int i) is used.
Making these single line, i.e. story += x + y + z; instead of "+= x; += y; += z;" is mostly a matter of personal preference.  In Java, strings are immutable, so repeated calls to += for a string is wasteful.  StringBuilder is preferable, but I don't know offhand whether C++ has an equivalent class, or whether strings are mutable in C++.

Transfered a few switch statements to maps.
Removed an unused part of allTextString, and its corresponding entry in allText.txt

Split constructNegativeEventStory() and constructPositiveEventStory() into functions for each individual story.  Mostly removed unused "const string" and "extern" within each smaller function.

Converted some switch statements into maps.
char hasdisguise(const Creature &cr) has been made to use maps in place of most of its switch statement, though it looks really weird.

Converted most of the world creation algorithm into maps, rather than a long series of identicle methods.
Converted armSpecificCreature() switch statement into a series of unique functions.  One step closer to having it map-based.
Exported switch statement from verifyworklocation() to external map.

Fixed error in news calculation.  Had "story += ..." but did not proceed to print story anywhere.
Replaced a number of void function(... char*); with string function(...); as well as (newsstoryst& ns) with (const newsstoryst ns)
Replaced 'void sexdesc(char *str)' and related with 'string sexdesc();' (four functions)

void review_mode(const short mode)
replaced the switch statement inside a for loop
with for loops inside a switch statement
Though more verbose, this means the switch statement is only checked once, instead of every iteration.

Cleaned up some siege and interrogation code.
Further attempts at untangling tendHostage() method.
Fixed a few instances of string += int
replaced with string += tostring(int)
as the autoconversion turns them into chars instead.

Replaced some while loops with for loops.
Reverted minor change to enemyattack();

Gutted almost exactly half the attack(Creature Creature) function, pulling out the new function  inflictDamage(const int numhits, Creature &a, Creature &t, const int aroll, const int droll, const bool sneak_attack, const attackst* attack_used)
Since it takes 7 parameters, this is suboptimal, but splitting the third largest function in half more than makes up for it.
Converted several ifelse chains from talkInCombat() into switch statements.
Converted each individual case into its own function.

Converted mode_site() from a while(true) function to while(increment_mode_site(char &bail_on_base, char &hostcheck, int &encounter_timer));

Made two new classes.
AttackInfliction and AttackSeverity
Currently both are being used as immutable data structures to simplify the parameters of the previously mentioned inflictDamage() and its internal function inflictNonZeroDamage()
There is much room for further implementation.

Converted the massive ifelse chain in attackst into a switch statement.
This allowed for redundant conditionals to be easily spotted and removed.  Fortunately there weren't any, but a switch statement with 29 cases is a hell of a lot cleaner than a 29 link if else chains.
CPPDepend agrees.  Its Cyclomatic Complexity was 163, but is now 7.

The regular expressions I used to mostly automate the conversion:

\s+
,\r\nENUM_

ENUM_(\w*)
map<string, int>::value_type\(\1, ENUM_\1\)

\s+(\w*),
case \1:\r\n\r\nbreak;\r\n

Fixed bug where guncontrol news stories displayed incorrectly.
A previous regular expression used to replace
story += ;
...
story += ;
with

Broke a number of else statements that were not confined to curly braces.
Relocated much of the strings used in articles to helper functions, namely the sections that rely on lawList[]
This allows for no usage of extern lawList[] within the news.cpp file.
It also allows for a significant reduction in local variables within any single function, and serves to make the numerous 'filename_string_x001' style string constants less ambigious.

Applied the above regular expressions (to convert ifelse chains into switch statements) to the founderQuestion function.  Loop is now much cleaner.
Added warning for player if attempting kidnapping, but all but one conservative posess "protects_from_kidnap"

4.12.23

Rewrote much of the printwall() method, removing a substantial amount of duplicate code.
Similar process with otherCrime() method.
Minor refactoring.
Massive ifelse chain VehicleType::VehicleType(MCD_STR xmlstring) replaced with nested switch statements.
Minor refactoring of news code.
Turned the while(true) loop in review() to while(iterateReview()) {}, and converted its ifelse chain to a switch statement.

Refactored some updateworld_laws() to remove duplicate code.
Changed location::rename() to use const string instead of const char*
BUGREPORT: Locations (Ministry of Love etc.) do not get renamed properly when laws change. (At least, not in multicity mode)

Refactored getThatGroundLoot()
Identified and repaired likely source of "no fireman raids" bug.
else if (lawList[LAW_FREESPEECH] <= -1 && LocationsPool::getInstance().getTimeUntilSiege(l, SIEGE_FIREMEN) == 0) 
		LocationsPool::getInstance().setTimeUntilSiege(l, SIEGE_FIREMEN, -1);
		offended_firemen = 0;
	
This code causes offended_firemen to be zeroed out every time its containing function is called, but from context it is clearly only supposed to do that if the conditional is passed.  i.e. missing curly braces.  This is why if statements are best written with curly braces, even if the statement only uses one line afterwards.

Hollowed out much of  huntingSiegePrint(const int l, int& numpres);
Clear instance of duplicate code, similarities between raids.  Work on later date.
Refactoring of presidentialElection();
CPPDepend now remarks 51 methods overly long/complex with Issues High
293 with Issues Medium

Fixed typo in tendhostage()
Dismantled printnews() into constituent parts.

Updated CppDepend so it doesn't include third-party code.
Fixed bug where game crashes if recruiter goes on vacation while recruiting.

Refactored pleadInnocent, others
created new enum for LegalDefense

Eliminated all usage of "extern short sitealarm"
This has allowed "sitealarm" to become a bool, and eliminated the ambiguity of "sitealarm != 0, sitealarm == 1, sitealarm < 1" etc.

Removed some dead code in chasesequence()
it turns out the while(true) loop does not have any exits apart from the return statements.
Therefore, the code that follows the loop cannot be executed.
Similar issue fixed within footchase()

Minor refactoring of select_augmentation(Creature *cr)
extracted new method add_augmentation(Creature *victim, Creature *cr, AugmentType *selected_aug)

Minor refactoring of displaystoryheader()

extracted new method attempt_find_keys() from start_car()

removed an "always false" conditional from creatureadvance()

CppDepend now indicates 0 methods overly long/complex with Issues High.

Removed recruitst unused field "timeleft"
Probably was copied from datest.
Removed recruitst unused field "level", and "task",
Sometimes written to, but it was never read.

Combined locx, locy, and locz into a single structure coordinatest
Minor refactoring.
CppDepend identifies "60 days of debt".

Refactored WeaponType so its const getters take an enumerator, rather than having a unique method for every single barely-used internal value.

Major refactoring of LocationsPool.  Similar to technique in WeaponType.
Located source of bug where disguise continues to be printed in red after returning to base.  Method of fixing, uncertain.
commondisplay.cpp Line 713 is related.

Restructuring of DeprecatedCreature class, laying groundwork for new ImmutableSimpleCreature superclass.
Split apart Deprecateddatest and related structures, so only files using them import them.

Minor refactoring of basemode.cpp

Fixed bug where liberal guardian special reports were incorrectly titled "Loot_CEOLoveLetter" and similar.

4.12.25
Creature names appear in red regardless of situation.
Game crashes when liberals set to auto-recruit.  Visual Studio debugger presents no usable information.  Online search suggests it may be an issue with compatibility of VS 2013 and VS 2017.

My hatred of Visual Studio and C++ grows.


X(1) The game crashes for me whenever I wait a day after assigning any squad member to "Recruiting" via the Activate menu.
X (2) Also, when I'm on site, every NPC's name is in red, even though some are Liberal or Moderate. If I talk to them, their names are in their proper colors, so it's just the display text while on site.
(3) Also another bug is when there are referendums/propositions and the population votes it seems to always vote in favour of the conservative ruling, even though when I check polls it goes 70-100% for liberal.
(4) Another one is the buildings don't change names after policy change, so even though you will only have police officers the building is still called deathsquad hq
X(5) Also another annoying bug, the slogan gets reset every time you exit the game.
(6) Another one is I think that repairing clothes is bugged and you can't sell damaged clothes so your equipment just gets flooded with broken equipment.
X (7) Disguise is always red.

Removed all usage and references to addstr_f(...) and other "add formatted strings" methods.  This fixed (1).
Fixed (5).  New means of saving and loading slogan led to the slogan being saved, but not loaded.
Fixed disguise continues to be printed in red after returning to base.
Fixed (7) by reverting hasdisguise() into 4.12.19 version.
Fixed (2), turns out the code checking the alignment was returning the creature's type instead.

(8) possible bug with encounterSpecial(

	case SPECIAL_CAFE_COMPUTER:
